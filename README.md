Proposal

Go Beer

Use the https://www.openbrewerydb.org/ API to locate local breweries
User Story:  Let's find a local brewery and go out for beer 
This app will tell us information about breweries.
The user types in their city and a list of local breweries comes up.
The information for each brewery includes name, type, location, website.
The user can select a brewery and get a map and some distance info (if we have current location) and hours ,phone, etc.

The app will save searches.
Wish list - Allow user to write notes to self about brewery and rate.

Project will be written using HTML, CSS, Javascript jquery, Foundation Framework
